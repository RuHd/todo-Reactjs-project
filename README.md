## ACCESSING THE APPLICATION ##

If you want to initialize the Application, you can access it directly by clicking on the github page of this repository. It'll give you the plain
functional environment on the browser. Or you can start the project on developing environment through NPM START.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT ##

This project was inspired by a youtube tutorial video, I've decided to create this project because I needed to sharp my logic skills in ReactJs
Thinking more on component-driven logic than the usual one, so I picked up this one to work upon it.

## FUNCTIONALITIES ##

On this Todolist, you can:

-- Add a new task
-- Edit a existing one
-- Clear all the todolist
-- Delete a task

## STYLES ##

I've used the SASS preprocessor to stylize the App.

## COMPONENTS ##

APP.JS => Main App Component
TODOFORM.JS => Component to the user inserts the new task
LIST.JS => Component Container to the task list
  TaskContainer => Component Container to the conditional components Edititem or Taskitem
  Edititem => Component for the user change an existing task
  Taskitem => Component that it's rendered as default right after adding a new task
